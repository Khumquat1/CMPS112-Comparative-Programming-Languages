This assignment is a airline reservation system for the Twilight
Zone Airlines. Given a request [fly( depart, arrive)] the program
will compute a flight schedule to get from the desired depart city
to the arrival city in a formatted list as per requirement of the 
assignment page. The database provided is the one used for the
Prolog code and uses the given information on airports and flights.
The logic is driven on the haversine formula to calculate great
circle distance and as such uses that distance to calculate 
flight time. There are no overnight flights thus every schedule
spans less than 24 hours. I have accounted for the 500 mph constant
plane speed and the 30 minute flight transfers. I have not implemented
an efficiency function to pull the shortest flight schedule amongst 
the various flight paths, thus there may be comically inefficient 
flight paths. The program will pull the first applicable path.
