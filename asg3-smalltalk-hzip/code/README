This assignment utilizes the object oriented language of Smalltalk 
to create a file compression utility, based on Huffman coding to compress
and decompress files. The file is called hzip.st and is run as follows:
    Usage : $ hzip.st -tcu inputfile [outfile]

    Options : This program has three difference options, exactly one
    of which is required to run:
  
           -t    Activate compression algorithm. Prints decoding tree.
           -c    Compress the input file to output or stdout.
           -u    Assumed compressed file is uncompressed to output.
           (-d)  Debug information : This feature has been cleaned and
                 removed upon completion of the assignment.

This assignment was the most challenging program to date for this course
but unsurprisingly was doable and simple (not easy) given the amount
of resources in the example files. Most of my code is pulled straight 
from the aforementioned files. The extension was needed to complete
the assignment, lots of debugging was needed to have correct functionality
as well as meet the requirements for the -t option. The output is padded
as per requirement pages.
